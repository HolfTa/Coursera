                <p>
                    Firstly, I read through the requirement for making this assignment, making sure I understood what parts are important.
                    I made sure I understood each element, I even looked up some external materials to use.
                    I used some cheet sheets for git and html, to make sure I am not forgetting anything. I documented the changes with Git.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <div class="column_title">
                    Second step
                </div>
                <p>
                    Next, I made the basic HTML layout, making sure each required element is present in my .html file. I used Git and VSC
                    for this. Then, I created the body and made sure that I prepare all three columns for the project. In this step belongs
                    typing down all three column text as well. I used Git to document my changes.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <div class="column_title">
                    Third step
                </div>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I worked on the css file following the task points, to make sure I am including every detail how my page should
                    look like. I focused on the lessons about responsive design, tested my page to make sure it is behaving as I intended. 
                    Publishing the project also belongs to this step, although I would rather consider it a step 4. Git &smile; .
